## 📚 About The Project

I've been studying clean architecture these couple of weeks, so I'm trying to practice what I've learned so far, and this app summarizes some of the concepts I've been getting along with pretty well.

This project is a Users API, where you can store users in the database using both REST and GraphQL.

In this project, I used Apollo Server, which I quite enjoy, and express.

I'm practicing a lot of both unit and integration tests, as you can see in the coveralls badge, and it made me realize how important testing is when building new features, refactoring, and stuff like that.
